&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspComputer systems are constructed of digital electronics.
 That means that their electronic circuits can exist in only
 one of two states: on or off. Most computer electronics use
 voltage levels to indicate their present state. For example,
 a transistor with five volts would be considered "on", while
 a transistor with no voltage would be considered "off." Not
 all computer hardware uses voltage, however. CD-ROM's, for
 example, use microscopic dark spots on the surface of the disk
 to indicate "off," while the ordinary shiny surface is considered "on."
 Hard disks use magnetism, while computer memory uses electric charges
 stored in tiny capacitors to indicate "on" or "off."<br><br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThese patterns of "on" and "off" stored inside the computer are used to
 encode numbers using the binary number system. The binary number system
 is a method of storing ordinary numbers such as 42 or 365 as patterns of
 1's and 0's. Because of their digital nature, a computer's electronics can
 easily manipulate numbers stored in binary by treating 1 as "on" and 0 as "off."
 Computers have circuits that can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and do many other
 things to numbers stored in binary.
