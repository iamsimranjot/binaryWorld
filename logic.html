<br><a name=lg><b><font color=#B45F04 size=6>Logic  Gates<b></font><br>

A logic gate is an electronic circuit/device which makes the logical decisions. To arrive at this decisions, the most common logic gates used are OR, AND, NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. The NAND and NOR gates are called universal gates. The exclusive-OR gate is another logic gate which can be constructed using AND, OR and NOT gate.

 	 	


Logic gates have one or more inputs and only one output. The output is active only for certain input combinations. Logic gates are the building blocks of any digital circuit. Logic gates are also called switches. With the advent of integrated circuits, switches have been replaced by TTL (Transistor Transistor Logic) circuits and CMOS circuits. Here I give example circuits on how to construct simples gates.

<br><b><font color=#B45F04 size=6>Symbolic Logic<b></font><br>

Boolean algebra derives its name from the mathematician George Boole. Symbolic Logic uses values, variables and operations.

 	 	

<br><b><font color=#B45F04 size=6>Inversion<b></font><br>	

A small circle on an input or an output indicates inversion. See the NOT, NAND and NOR gates given below for examples.<br>

<br><b><font color=#B45F04 size=6>Multiple Input Gates<b></font><br>		
Given commutative and associative laws, many logic gates can be implemented with more than two inputs, and for reasons of space in circuits, usually multiple input, complex gates are made. You will encounter such gates in real world (maybe you could analyze an ASIC lib to find this).

<br><b><font color=#B45F04 size=6>AND Gate<b></font><br>
The AND gate performs logical multiplication, commonly known as AND function. The AND gate has two or more inputs and single output. The output of AND gate is HIGH only when all its inputs are HIGH (i.e. even if one input is LOW, Output will be LOW).



If X and Y are two inputs, then output F can be represented mathematically as F = X.Y, Here dot (.) denotes the AND operation. Truth table and symbol of the AND gate is shown in the figure below.

.
If X = 0 and Y = 0, then both diodes D1 and D2 are forward biased and thus both diodes conduct and pull F low.

 	 	


If X = 0 and Y = 1, D2 is reverse biased, thus does not conduct. But D1 is forward biased, thus conducts and thus pulls F low.

 	 	


If X = 1 and Y = 0, D1 is reverse biased, thus does not conduct. But D2 is forward biased, thus conducts and thus pulls F low.

 	 	


If X = 1 and Y = 1, then both diodes D1 and D2 are reverse biased and thus both the diodes are in cut-off and thus there is no drop in voltage at F. Thus F is HIGH.

 	 	
<br><b><font color=#B45F04 size=6>Switch Representation of AND Gate<b></font><br>	
In the figure below, X and Y are two switches which have been connected in series (or just cascaded) with the load LED and source battery. When both switches are closed, current flows to LED.

 	<b><font color=#B45F04 size=6>OR Gate<b></font><br>
The OR gate performs logical addition, commonly known as OR function. The OR gate has two or more inputs and single output. The output of OR gate is HIGH only when any one of its inputs are HIGH (i.e. even if one input is HIGH, Output will be HIGH).

 	 	


If X and Y are two inputs, then output F can be represented mathematically as F = X+Y. Here plus sign (+) denotes the OR operation. Truth table and symbol of the OR gate is shown in the figure below.

<br><a name=ug><b><font color=#B45F04 size=6>Universal Gates<b></font><br>
Universal gates are the ones which can be used for implementing any gate like AND, OR and NOT,
 or any combination of these basic gates; NAND and NOR gates are universal gates. But there are some rules 
that need to be followed when implementing NAND or NOR based gates.

To facilitate the conversion to NAND and NOR logic, we have two new graphic symbols for these gates.
<b>NAND<b>

<b>NOR<b>

<br><b><font color=#B45F04 size=6>Realization of logic function using NAND gates<b></font><br>
Any logic function can be implemented using NAND gates. To achieve this, first the logic function has to be written in Sum of Product (SOP) form.
 Once logic function is converted to SOP, then is very easy to implement using NAND gate. In other words any logic circuit with AND gates in first
 level and OR gates in second level can be converted into a NAND-NAND gate circuit.

 	 	


Consider the following SOP expression

 	 	


F = W.X.Y + X.Y.Z + Y.Z.W

 	 	


The above expression can be implemented with three AND gates in first stage and one OR gate in second stage as shown in figure.

If bubbles are introduced at AND gates output and OR gates inputs (the same for NOR gates), the above circuit becomes as shown in figure.
<br><img src="gates_sop2.gif"><br>

Now replace OR gate with input bubble with the NAND gate. Now we have circuit which is fully implemented with just NAND gates.

Any logic function can be implemented using NOR gates. To achieve this, first the logic function has to be written in 
Product of Sum (POS) form. Once it is converted to POS, then it's very easy to implement using NOR gate. In other words any
 logic circuit with OR gates in first level and AND gates in second level can be converted into a NOR-NOR gate circuit.

 	 	


Consider the following POS expression

 	 	


F = (X+Y) . (Y+Z)

 	 	


The above expression can be implemented with three OR gates in first stage and one AND gate in second stage as shown in figure.
<br><img src="gates_pos1.gif"><br>
 	 	


If bubble are introduced at the output of the OR gates and the inputs of AND gate, the above circuit becomes as shown in figure.
<br><img src="gates_pos2.gif"><br>
 	 	


Now replace AND gate with input bubble with the NOR gate. Now we have circuit which is fully implemented with just NOR gates.
